#### UFOs
## Overview of the Project

Analysing the UFO data and being able to sort, the times the UFO's were viewed based on the date, state, country, city and the shape of the UFO's


## TResults

We were able to vary the data based on the date, the advantage of this was we had a full date i.e(format = 1/13/2010) this gave us an exact date as compared to putting ayear into the date value and getting a wide range of results. 
we are able to filter the data and view the place the UFO was viewed and the comments written by the person inserting the filter data. we were able to determine that we had 3 UFO sittings on nthe 1/13/2020 just by clicking that date and were able to determine that in Bonita on the 1/1/2010 there  was a UFO that was viewed that was known by the lights it displayed

##Results

This is a god design, but we will need to update our filters and have them reset to zero, so that after they have checked the data of the first user, theywill automaticallt=y reset to zero without having to delete the data
